## \#0. why am I doing this?

I've fallen into a routine. I am a fully time researcher. What I do daily are in the arena of what people call data science. I get data and analyse it using existing algorithms and software. Sometimes I develop new analysis tools. Most of the times though, I simply work on pipeline scripts that facilitates the data anlysis with known protocols.  
There were times when I was excited to learn new programming languages and algorithms for the sake of learning. Over the years of working, however, this is no longer the case. I am more concerned about 'is my hour spent on learning this useful for immediate completion of this project?' than 'is this interesting to me?'.  
The fact is, I love doing my job. Nevertheless, I needed an outlet wherein I was free to do random things without the fear that I put in myself about my day-to-day operations as a full time researcher in an actively growing field.  

So here I am. This is mostly for me, but perhaps you would find some of my musings useful.
